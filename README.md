# Workforce Allocation Optimization Tool (WAO)

# Acknowledgments

The Workforce Allocation Optimization Tool was modeled from work rendered by the Public Health Informatics Institute (PHII) on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded Workforce Planning and Deployment Optimization project (July 2013 – June 2018). The Workforce Allocation Optimization Tool was initially developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology, in collaboration with PHII (September 2013 – June 2014). Enhancements on the tool’s optimization model, the Excel-based user interface, and documentation were developed by an independent contractor (August 2014 – October 2014), in consultation with PHII, CDC and Jhpiego. The tool was developed to strengthen the health workforce allocation assignment process for Ministries of Health. 

In partnership with PHII and CDC, Health Informatics Training and Research Advancement Center (HITRAC) has taken up the Excel-based tool and transformed the Workforce Allocation Optimization Tool into a distributed web system (January 2016  - June 2018). HITRAC has maintained how the tool runs, and has added a web interface to capture input and display Workforce Allocation Optimization Tool results.

# Overview

The objective of the Workforce Allocation Optimization Tool is to support the assignment of recent healthcare graduates, i.e., future healthcare workers (HCWs), based on the demand at different locations, the HCWs’ salaries and potential budget restrictions, and the HCWs’ location preferences for assignment, with the following goals: (i) to fulfill each location’s demand, as much as possible, and (ii) to maximize the HCWs’ satisfaction resulting from the assignments, thereby improving performance and retention. This repository contains the source code for the server-side component of the WAO, which is developed in PHP 5 using CodeIgniter framework. The database is MySQL and the server is Apache.
